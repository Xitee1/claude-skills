# My custom claude skills

## How to use
### Variant 1 - Git clone
1. Make sure `~/.claude/skills` does not exist (currently claude code doesn't auto-generate this).
2. Clone this repo into `~/.claude` as `skills`: `git clone git@github.com:Xitee1/claude-skills.git ~/.claude/skills`

### Variant 2 - manual copy
1. Create the folder `~/.claude/skills`
2. Copy the individual skill folders you want to use in there
